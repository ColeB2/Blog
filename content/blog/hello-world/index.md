description: "The write-up of how I made this blog right here, and how you too can (hopefully) do the same."
---

As with all dev/tech blogs, I have decided to create my first blog post be about
the process of creating said blog. Original, I know. If you want to skip to the
the technical stuff below, you can here.(Link to technical part below) If you
want to read more of my ramblings, than that is okay too.

First off, quick description on what we are creating. This is a blog using
Gatsby, and the gatsby-starter-blog starter. Gatsby has many tutorials on how to
get started, and it would be remiss of me to more or less tell you what has
already been written by better devs than me, so I will link you to them. 


The beginner guide [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/)
and the intermediate/advanced quick start for gatsby
[here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/). This write-up will most
definitely brush through some aspest that a beginner might not understand so I
highly recommend checking out the beginner guide if anything written here does
not make sense. Maybe in the future I will create more posts about those things
that are more beginner friendly but for now, I will assume some level of
technical knowledge.

## The Technical Bits

First off, I installed the gatsbi-cli tool very simply using npm...

```console
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

Then created the blog using the gatsby-starter-blog, replacing the
gatsby-starter-blog with the name of the folder I wanted to store the blog in.
(I chose blog).

```console
npx gatsby new gatsby-starter-blog https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog
```

Personally, I immediately started writing this post, and tinkering with the blog
lay out. You can start the dev server up simply with:

```console
gatsby develop
```

Rest of the blog here...
Lorem ipsum finish.
